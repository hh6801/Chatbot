# OptiBot – AI-Powered Help Center Assistant

This project scrapes OptiSigns Help Center articles, converts them into Markdown, and uploads them to an OpenAI Vector Store for use in a custom GPT Assistant. It runs daily using a cron job on a DigitalOcean Droplet.

## ✅ Features

- Automatically fetches articles from Zendesk Help Center API.
- Cleans and converts content into structured Markdown.
- Uploads new/updated articles to OpenAI Vector Store.
- Tracks content hashes to prevent duplicate uploads.
- Scheduled to run daily via cron on a DigitalOcean Droplet.

## 🐳 Docker & Deployment

### Build Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t optibot .
```

### Push to Docker Hub
```bash
docker tag optibot <your-dockerhub-username>/optibot
docker push <your-dockerhub-username>/optibot
```

## ☁️ Deploy with Cron on DigitalOcean

1. Create a new Droplet via [DigitalOcean](https://cloud.digitalocean.com).
2. SSH into your Droplet:
   ```bash
   ssh root@<your-droplet-ip>
   ```
3. Clone your repo & install Docker if needed.
4. Pull the latest image:
   ```bash
   docker pull <your-dockerhub-username>/optibot
   ```

5. Create `run.sh` script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   docker run --rm <your-dockerhub-username>/optibot
   ```

6. Make it executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x run.sh
   ```

7. Add cron job:
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```
   Add this line to run daily at 7AM UTC:

### 🔧 How to Build Docker Image (for linux/amd64)

If you're building on an Apple Silicon (e.g., M1/M2 Mac) or any non-amd64 architecture, make sure to target the correct platform:

```bash
docker buildx create --use
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t your_dockerhub_username/optibot --push .
```

Or for local test only (no push):

```bash
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64 -t optibot . --load
```
